ajasta -- simultaneous timers.

ajasta can be used to time things. It keeps track of 26 separate ms-accuracy
timers simultaneously, each of which can be started, stopped, restarted, and
split at any time. You can also name the timers so you know which is which.

ajasta works in the terminal and is intended to be very small yet functional.

The timers are referred to by the alphabet a-z. Key commands:
'a'-'z': start/stop the respective timer
'A'-'Z': record a split time for the respective timer (print out and preserve
         current value without stopping the timer)
'!' followed by 'a'-'z': reset a timer (set its value to 0). Type another '!' to
                         reset all the shown timers.
'?' followed by 'a'-'z': (re)name a timer
'.' stop all running timers
':' take split time for all running timers
' ' (space) start all shown timers
'#': quit

Timers are not shown until you have either started them once or named them.
(Therefore, the screen is initially empty.)
